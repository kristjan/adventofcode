All the nodes in this input can contain their neighbor's data except for a wall
of huge nodes at y=19, and the empty node is on the other side of the wall. So
the minimal possible path is:

4 move the space to wall
23 to the end of the wall
2 across the wall
24 down the wall (and next to the Goal's x)
18 to y = 0
1 to move the Goal into the space
36 times:
  4 to move the empty space back in front of the goal
  1 to move the Goal into it

= 252
